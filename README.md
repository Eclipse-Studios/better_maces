one (it may not work or at least not as intended).

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/mace) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Of course! This datapack is a side project I made while making another massive datapack. For more updates about it join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)!.

#### Q: Is this datapack compatible with other datapacks?

A: Yes it is. This datapack follows the [Smithed](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/) conventions to ensure datapack compatibility.
