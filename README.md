    ❓ FAQ

  <p>
    
#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older/newer versions?

A: This datapack doens't work on older versions than 1.21 (simply because the mace wasn't added yet). If for whatever reason you want to use it in a newer version and the official update hasn't happened just download the lastest version and change inside the `pack.mcmeta` of the datapack the "[pack_format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format)" value to the desired one (it may not work or at least not as intended).

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tpa) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Of course! This datapack is a side project I made while making another massive datapack. For more updates about it join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)!.

#### Q: Is this datapack compatible with other datapacks?

A: Yes it is. This datapack follows the [Smithed](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/) conventions to ensure datapack compatibility.

To unistall the datapack run `/function mace:unistall` before removing it from the datapacks folder, that will remove all scoreboards and more stuff that the datapack uses.
