#### Q: Why can I go through the ground?

A: Well, in an ideal world you wouldn't be able to. I wanted this datapack to be as efficient as possible and if I wanted to make so you couldn't go through the ground I would need to simulate gravity using block displays and that will be less efficient and more time consuming. I know this sounds lame as this is a "bug", but don't worry, I will come back and "fix" it someday, but for now I'm working on more important projects that deserve most of my time and this datapack was ment to be a quick side project, nothing too complex, so we will need to wait a bit until I update it. It will happen, but not now.
    
#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older/newer versions?

A: This datapack doens't work on older versions than 1.21 (simply because the mace wasn't added yet). If for whatever reason you want to use it in a newer version and the official update hasn't happened just download the lastest version and change inside the `pack.mcmeta` of the datapack the "[pack_format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format)" value to the desired one (it may not work or at least not as intended).

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/mace) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Of course! This datapack is a side project I made while making another massive datapack. For more updates about it join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)!.
